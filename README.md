Hello, if you're reading this, it means you've found my not-so-private repository for my game, PhotoVs. While I would greatly prefer it if you didn't use this source code for your own uses, I can't exactly stop you, so all I ask is that if you do take a look, please use the project for educational purposes.

At some point, this repository will either stop being updated and changes will be made private or the repository itself will be made private. This is a while off. I'll provide some warning when that is about to happen.

In terms of actual code quality, this project is a bit different from my usual standard; I'm first and foremost focused on results and finishing this project rather than efficiency. This means weird hacks and rushed (read: outright bad) code that sometimes isn't so maintainable, which might later get refactored/rewritten if I misjudged my requirements.

In terms of features, jrpg implements an Entity Component framework and a JavaScript scripting framework  that will largely serve as the basis for the functionality of the game.
